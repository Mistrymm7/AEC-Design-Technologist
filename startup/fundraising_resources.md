# Notes:
- Go ahead with Safe (Alternative : Convertible Note, Debt, Equity)
- liquidation preference : **non-participating liquidation preference, typically 1x,** for **preferred shareholders**. This means investors would receive their initial investment back before common shareholders in the event of an exit, but not participate in additional proceeds.
    - **liquidation preference called “1x, non participating.**” Since liquidation preferences are expressed as a multiple of the initial investment, the **1x means they will receive a dollar back for every dollar invested, a full recouping of their money** — as long as there’s enough to cover this. Common shareholders will divvy up what’s left.
    - **term “non participating” means that the investor has a choice.** He or she can receive their original investment back or convert their preferred stock into common stock and share in the proceeds according to their equity ownership, whichever amount is greater.
- **Preferred participating is the thing you want to be wary of. Beware of ‘double dipping’**
- Equity Structure :
    - Offering **common shares to founders** and **preferred shares to investors**, with the **latter having limited control rights**.
- **Anti-dilution Provisions: Using a broad-based weighted average anti-dilution provision to protect investors from dilution while not excessively penalizing the founders in case of a down round.**
    - also **ask for [anti-dilution provisions](https://www.svb.com/blogs/theron-mccollough/startup-equity-dilution). These are clauses designed to protect an investor’s ownership percentage from being diluted in future funding rounds where the company issues new stock for a lower price**. If an investor has negotiated an anti-dilution clause, their stake in the company is **maintained through formulas that turn each preferred share into more than one common share.**
- **Pre-emptive Rights: Granting pre-emptive rights to existing investors, allowing them to maintain their ownership percentage in future fundraising rounds, but without overly burdensome restrictions that might impede raising capital.**
- **No Redemption Rights: Avoiding redemption rights that force the company to repurchase investors' shares after a certain period, as this can create financial pressure and reduce flexibility for the company.**
- Protective Provisions: **Reasonable protective provisions that give investors veto rights over specific decisions, such as the sale of the company or amendments to the company's charter,** without overly restricting the founders' ability to manage the company.
- Board Representation :
- Drag Along Rights :  Reasonable drag-along provisions that require a majority of common shareholders to agree on a sale before forcing minority shareholders to sell their shares, ensuring founders have a say in any exit decisions.
- Cap Table :
- Vesting: A standard **vesting schedule for founders, typically 4 years with a 1-year cliff.**
- Dividends: Non-cumulative dividends for preferred shareholders, which means dividends are not accumulated if not paid. This helps conserve cash for the company's growth.
